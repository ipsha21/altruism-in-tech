## Introduction
Altruism in Tech is a project being developed under the [Mozilla Leadership Training Program, 2017](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/mozilla-open-leadership-training-series) and mentored by [Kristie Whitaker.](https://github.com/KirstieJane)

The project is designed to help and guide people in tech who have lost their way, or find it difficult to start in the first place. The idea is to make the tech industry more inclusive and welcoming for a diverse set of people, by connecting them to a mentor, over internet for a call. The aim is to create a portal where interested Mozilla employees can volunteer by making themselves available for a one-on-one meeting, with a newcomer seeking help in their area of expertise.

## Why does this project exist?
- Lack of diversity in field of tech
- Newcomers suffering from the impostor syndrome: Fear of not being “good enough”
- Lack of proper guidance while learning a new technology
- Absence of a mentor to reach out to, when in doubt 

## What we plan to do about it?
- Lend an open ear and listen to their problem
- Try and help clear the doubts and insecurities of a newcomer
- Guide them in some specific domain of tech
- Impact the world and build a better tech future, one individual at a time

## How are we doing it?
The goal is to develop a website where volunteers can register themselves as mentors, and where a newcomer can search through the database of mentors to connect with someone experienced in the field they're interested in working/learning.The mentor-mentee would be connected when both parties approve a connection. The goal is to:
- Have a database of volunteers willing to make themselves available online (not necessarily a call, if you’re not comfortable) at some pre-decided time slots.
- Give newcomers the opportunity to search and request to connect with a mentor based on their common area of interest.
- Set up a meeting (connecting online) between a mutually acknowledging mentor and a newbie.
- Have an ask-to-answer platform on the website.

## What do we need?

### Volunteers/Mentors
*(Bear with us while we work on letting you inspire and impact the world. Meanwhile come [say hi](https://gitter.im/AltruismInTech/Lobby#), and let us know how we could do things better)*
First things first, if you are considering being a mentor, a huge hug of appreciation for you. The world needs more of you and we are delighted to have you on board. 
You are a potential mentor if you check any one or more of the following:

- are experienced in some domain of tech
- have something to share with a newcomer
- can devote a teensy-tiny amount of time out of your busy schedule (**we *really* appreciate this**)
- can answer some questions online, share advice, resources, good practices, tips and tricks, or anything else that you think can be helpful.

### Newcomers/Mentee
